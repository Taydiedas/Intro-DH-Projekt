DEDICATION. 


Dim  forms,  ye  hover  near,  a  shadowy  train. 

As  erst  upon  my  troubled  sight  ye  stole. 

Say,  shall  1  strive  to  hold  you  once  again  ? 

Still  for  the  fond  illusion  yearns  my  soul? 

Ye  press  around!  Come  then,  resume  your  reign,  5 

As  upward  from  the  vapory  mist  ye  roll; 

Within  my  breast  youth’s  throbbing  pulses  bound; 

Fann’d  by  the  magic  air  that  breathes  your  march  around. 

Shades  fondly  loved  appear,  your  train  attending, 

And  visions  fair  of  many  a  blissful  day;  10 

First-love  and  friendship  their  fond  accents  blending, 

Like  to  some  ancient,  half-expiring  lay; 

Sorrow  revives,  her  wail  of  anguish  sending 
Back  o’er  life’s  devious  labyrinthine  way. 

The  dear  ones  naming  who,  in  life’s  fair  morn,  15 

By  Fate  beguiled,  from  my  embrace  were  torn. 

They  hearken  not  unto  my  later  song, 

The  souls  to  whom  my  earlier  lays  I  sang; 

Dispersed  forever  is  the  friendly  throng, 

Mute  are  the  voices  that  responsive  rang.  20 

My  song  resoundeth  stranger  crowds  among, 

E'en  their  applause  is  to  my  heart  a  pang; 

And  those  who  heard  me  once  with  joyful  heart. 

If  yet  they  live,  now  wander  far  .apart. 

A  strange  unwonted  yearning  doth  my  soul,  25 

To  yon  calm  solem  spirit-land,  upraise; 

In  faltering  cadence  now  my  numbers  roll. 

As  when  on  harp  ZEolian,  Zephyr  plays; 

My  pulses  thrill,  tears  flow  without  control, 

A  tender  mood  my  steadfast  heart  o’ersways;  30 

What  I  possess  as  from  afar  I  see; 

Those  I  have  lost  become  realities  to  me. 


PROLOGUE  FOR  THE  THEATER. 
Manager.  Dramatic  Poet.  Merryman. 

MANAGER. 

Ye  twain,  whom  I  so  oft  have  found 
True  friends  in  trouble  and  distress. 

Say,  in  our  scheme  on  German  ground, 

What  prospect  have  we  of  success? 

Fain  would  I  please  the  public,  win  their  thanks; 
Because  they  live  and  let  live,  as  is  meet. 

The  posts  are  now  erected  and  the  planks, 

And  all  look  forward  to  a  festal  treat. 

Their  places  taken,  they,  with  eyebrows  rais’d. 

Sit  patiently,  and  fain  would  be  amaz’d. 

I  know  the  art  to  hit  the  public  taste, 

Yet  so  perplex’d  I  ne’er  have  been  before; 

’Tis  true,  they’re  not  accustomed  to  the  best. 

But  then  they  read  immensely,  that’s  the  bore. 

.How  make  our  entertainment  striking,  new. 

And  yet  significant  and  pleasing  too? 

For  to  be  plain,  1  love  to  see  the  throng, 

As  to  our  booth  the  living  tide  progresses; 

As  wave  on  wave  successive  rolls  along, 

And  through  heaven’s  narrow  portal  forceful  presses; 
Still  in  broad  daylight,  ere  the  clock  strikes  four, 
With  blows  their  way  toward  the  box  they  take; 

And,  as  for  bread  in  famine,  at  the  baker’s  door. 

For  tickets  are  content  their  necks  to  break. 

Such  various  minds  the  bard  alone  can  sway, 

My  friend,  oh  work  this  miracle  to-day! 

POET. 

Oh  speak  not  of  the  motley  multitude, 

At  whose  aspect  the  spirit  wings  its  flight; 

Shut  out  the  noisy  crowd,  whose  vortex  rude

Still  draws  ns  downwai'd  with  resistless  might. 

Lead  to  some  nook,  where  silence  loves  to  brood. 

Where  only  for  the  bard  blooms  pure  delight, 

Where  love  and  friendship,  gracious  heavenly  pair,  65 
Our  hearts  true  bliss  create,  and  tend  with  fostering  care. 
What  there  up-welleth  deep  within  the  breast. 

What  there  the  timid  lip  shap’d  forth  in  sound, 

A  failure  now,  how  haply  well  expressed, 

In  the  wild  tumult  of  the  hour  is  drown’d;  70 

Oft  doth  the  perfect  form  then  first  invest 
The  poet’s  thought,  when  years  have  sped  their  round; 
What  dazzles  satisfies  the  present  hour, 

The  genuine  lives,  of  coming  years  the  dower. 

MERRYMAN. 

This  cant  about  posterity  I  hate;  75 

About  posterity  were  I  to  prate. 

Who  then  the  living  would  amuse?  For  they 
Will  have  diversion,  ay,  and  ’tis  their  due. 

A  sprightly  fellow’s  presence  at  your  play, 

Methinks,  should  always  go  for  something  too;  80 

Whose  genial  wit  the  audience  still  inspires. 

Is  not  embittered  by  its  changefull  mood; 

A  wider  circle  he  desires. 

To  move  with  greater  power,  the  multitude. 

To  work,  then!  Prove  a  master  in  your  art!  85 

Let  phantasy  with  all  her  choral  train, 

Sense,  reason,  feeling,  passion,  bear  their  part. 

But  mark!  let  folly  also  mingle  in  the  strain! 

MANAGER. 

And,  chief,  let  incidents  enough  arise! 

A  show  they  want,  they  come  to  feast  their  eyes.  90 

When  stirring  scenes  before  them  are  display’d. 

At  which  the  gaping  crowd  may  wondering  gaze, 

Your  reputation  is  already  made, 

The  man  you  are  all  love  to  praise. 

The  masses  you  alone  through  masses  can  subdue,  95 

Each  then  selects  in  time  what  suits  his  bent. 

Bring  much,  you  somewhat  bring  to  not  a  few. 

And  from  the  house  goes  every  one  content. 

You  give  a  piece,  in  pieces  give  it,  friend!

Such  a  ragout,  success  must  needs  attend;  100 

’Tis  easy  to  serve  up,  as  easy  to  invent. 

A  finish’d  whole  what  boots  it  to  present! 

’Twill  be  in  pieces  by  the  public  rent. 

POET. 

How  mean  such  handicraft  as  this  you  cannot  feel! 

How  it  revolts  the  genuine  artist’s  mind!  105 

The  sorry  trash  in  which  these  coxcombs  deal. 

Is  here  approved  on  principle,  I  find. 

MANAGER. 

Such  a  reproof  disturbs  me  not  a  whit! 

Who  on  efficient  work  is  bent, 

Must  choose  the  fittest  instrument.  110 

Consider!  ’tis  soft  wood  you  have  to  split; 

Think  too  for  whom  you  write,  I  pray! 

One  comes  to  while  an  hour  away; 

One  from  the  festive  board,  a  sated  guest; 

Others,  more  dreaded  than  the  rest,  115 

From  journal-reading  hurry  to  the  play. 

As  to  a  masquerade,  with  absent  minds,  they  press, 

Sheer  curiosity  their  footsteps  winging; 

Ladies  display  their  persons  and  their  dress, 

Actors  unpaid  their  service  bringing.  120 

What  dreams  beguile  you  on  your  poet’s  height? 

What  puts  a  full  house  in  a  merry  mood? 

More  closely  view  your  patrons  of  the  night! 

The  half  are  cold,  the  other  half  are  rude. 

One,  the  play  over,  craves  a  game  of  cards;  125 

Another  a  wild  night  in  wanton  joy  would  spend. 

Poor  fool,  the  muses’  fair  regards 
Why  court  for  such  a  paltry  end? 

I  tell  you,  give  them  more,  still  more,  ’tis  all  I  ask. 

Thus  you  will  ne’er  stray  widely  from  the  goal;  130 

Your  audience  seek  to  mystify,  cajole; — 

To  satisfy  them — that’s  a  harder  task. 

What  ails  thee?  art  enraptured  or  distressed? 

POET. 

Depart!  elsewhere  another  servant  choose! 

What!  shall  the  bard  his  godlike  power  abuse?

Man’s  loftiest  right,  kind  nature’s  high  bequest. 

For  your  mean  purpose  basely  sport  away? 

Whence  comes  his  mastery  o’er  the  human  breast. 

Whence  o’er  the  elements  his  sway, 

But  from  the  harmony  that,  gushing  from  his  soul,  140 
Draws  back  into  his  heart  into  wondrous  whole? 

When  round  her  spindle,  with  unceasing  drone. 

Nature  still  whirls  th’  unending  thread  of  life; 

When  Being’s  jarring  crowds,  together  thrown, 

Mingle  in  harsh  inextricable  strife;  145 

Who  deals  their  course  unvaried  till  it  falls. 

In  rhythmic  flow  to  music’s  measur’d  tone? 

Each  solitary  note  whose  genius  calls, 

To  swell  the  mighty  choir  in  unison? 

Who  in  the  raging  storm  sees  passion  lower,  150 

Or  flush  of  earnest  thought  in  evening’s  glow. 

Who,  in  the  spring-time,  every  fairest  flower 
Along  the  loved  one’s  path  would  strew? 

From  green  and  common  leaves  whose  hand  doth  twine, 
The  wreath  of  glory,  won  in  every  field?  155 

Makes  sure  Olympos,  blends  the  powers  divine? — 

Man’s  mighty  spirit,  in  the  bard  reveal’d! 

MERRYMAST. 

Come  then,  employ  your  lofty  inspiration, 

And  carry  on  the  poet’s  avocation. 

Just  as  we  carry  on  a  love  affair.  160 

Two  meet  by  chance,  are  pleased,  they  linger  there, 
Insensibly  are  link’d,  they  scarce  know  how; 

Fortune  seems  now  propitious,  adverse  now, 

Then  come  alternate  rapture  and  despair; 

And  ’tis  a  true  romance  ere  one’s  aware.  165 

Just  such  a  drama  let  us  now  compose. 

Plunge  boldly  into  life— its  depths  disclose! 

.Each  lives  it,  not  to  many  is  it  known, 

’Twill  interest  wheresoever  seiz’d  and  shown; 

Bright  pictures,  but  obscure  their  meaning:  170 

A  ray  of  truth  through  error  gleaming, 

Thus  you  the  best  elixir  brew, 

To  charm  mankind,  and  edify  them  too. 

Then  youth’s  fair  blossoms  crowd  to  view  your  play. 

And  wait  as  on  an  oracle;' while  they.

The  tender  souls,  who  love  the  melting  mood, 
Suck  from  your  work  their  melancholy  food; 
Now  this  one,  and  now  that,  you  deeply  stir. 
Each  sees  the  working  of  his  heart  laid  bare; 
Their  tears,  their  laughter,  you  command  with 
The  lofty  still  they  honor,  the  illusive  love, 
Tour  finish’d  gentlemen  you  ne’er  can  please; 
A  growing  mind  alone  will  grateful  prove. 

POET. 

Then  give  me  back  youth’s  golden  prime. 
When  my  own  spirit  too  was  growing. 

When  from  my  heart  th’  unbidden  rhyme 
Gush’d  forth,  a  fount  forever  flowing; 

Then  shadowy  mist  the  world  conceal’d. 

And  every  bud  sweet  promise  made. 

Of  wonders  yet  to  be  reveal’d, 

As  through  the  vales,  with  blooms  inlaid. 
Culling  a  thousand  flowers  I  stray’d. 

Naught  had  I,  yet  a  rich  profusion; 

The  thirst  for  truth,  joy  in  each  fond  illusion. 
Give  me  unquell’d  those  impulses  to  prove; — 
Rapture  so  deep,  its  ecstasy  was  pain. 

The  power  of  hate,  the  energy  of  love, 

Give  me,  oh  give  me  back  my  youth  again! 

MERRYMAN. 

Youth,  my  good  friend,  you  certainly  require 
When  foes  in  battle  round  you  press, 

When  a  fair  maid,  her  heart  on  fire, 

Hangs  on  your  neck  with  fond  caress, 

When  from  afar,  the  victor’s  crown, 

Allures  you  in  the  race  to  run; 

Or  when  in  revelry  you  drown 

Your  sense,  the  whirling  dance  being  done. 

But  the  familiar  chords  among 
Boldly  to  sweep,  with  graceful  cunning, 

While  to  its  goal,  the  verse  along 
Its  winding  path  is  sweetly  running: 

This  task  is  yours,  old  gentlemen,  to-day; 

Nor  are  you  therefore  in  less  reverence  held; 
Age  does  not  make  us  childish,  as  folk  say, 

It  finds  us  genuine  children  e’en  in  eld.

MANAGER. 

A  truce  to  words,  mere  empty  sound,  215 

Let  deeds  at  length  appear,  my  friends! 

While  idle  compliments  you  round. 

You  might  achieve  some  useful  ends. 

Why  talk  of  the  poetic  vein? 

Who  hesitates  will  never  know  it;  220 

If  bards  ye  are,  as  ye  maintain. 

Now  let  your  inspiration  show  it. 

To  you  is  known  what  we  require. 

Strong  drink  to  sip  is  our  desire; 

Come,  brew  me  such  without  delay!  225 

To-morrow  sees  undone,  what  happens  not  to-day; 

Still  forward  press,  nor  ever  tire! 

The  possible,  with  steadfast  trust, 

Kesolve  should  by  the  forelock  grasp; 

Then  she  will  ne’er  let  go  her  clasp,  230 

And  labors  on,  because  she  must. 

On  German  hoards,  you’re  well  aware. 

The  taste  of  each  may  have  full  sway; 

Therefore  in  bringing  out  your  play. 

Nor  scenes  nor  mechanism  spare!  235 

Heaven’s  lamps  employ;  the  greatest  and  the  least, 

Be  lavish  of  the  stellar  lights, 

Water,  and  fire,  and  rocky  heights. 

Spare  not  at  all,  nor  birds  nor  beast. 

Thus  let  creation’s  ample  sphere  240 

Forthwith  in  this  our  narrow  booth  appear. 

And  with  considerate  speed,  through  fancy’s  spell, 

Journey  from  heaven,  thence  through  the  world,  to  hell!

The  three  Archangels  come  forward. 

RAPHAEL. 

Still  quiring  as  in  ancient  time 
With  brother  spheres  in  rival  song, 

The  sun  with  thunder-march  sublime 
Moves  his  predestin’d  course  along. 

Angels  are  strengthen’d  by  his  sight, 

Though  fathom  him  no  angel  may; 

Resplendent  are  the  orbs  of  light. 

As  on  creation’s  primal  day. 

GABRIEL. 

And  lightly  spins  earth’s  gorgeous  sphere, 

Swifter  than  thought  its  rapid  flight; 

Alternates  Eden-brightness  clear, 

With  solemn,  dread-inspiring  night; 

The  foaming  waves,  with  murmurs  hoarse, 

Against  the  rocks’  deep  base  are  hurl’d; 

And  in  the  sphere’s  eternal  course 
Are  rocks  and  ocean  swiftly  whirl’d. 

MICHAEL. 

And  rival  tempests  rush  amain 
From  sea  to  land,  from  land  to  sea. 

And  raging  form  a  wondrous  chain 
Of  deep  mysterious  agency; 

Full  in  the  thunder’s  tierce  career, 

Flaming  the  swift  destructions  play; 

But,  Lord,  thy  messengers  revere 
The  mild  procession  of  thy  day.

THE  THREE. 

Angels  are  strengthened  by  thy  sight, 

Though  fathom  thee  no  angel  may; 

Thy  works  still  shine  with  splendor  bright. 

As  on  creation’s  primal  day. 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

Since  thou,  0  Lord,  approachest  us  once  more, 

And  how  it  fares  with  us,  to  ask  art  fain. 

Since  then  hast  kindly  welcom’d  me  of  yore, 

Thou  see’st  me  also  now  among  thy  train. 

Excuse  me,  fine  harangues  I  cannot  make. 

Though  all  the  circle  look  on  me  with  scorn; 

My  pathos  soon  thy  laughter  would  awake, 

Iladst  thou  the  laughing  mood  not  long  forsworn. 

Of  suns  and  worlds  I  nothing  have  to  say, 

I  see  alone  mankind’s  self-torturing  pains. 

The  little  world-gold  still  the  self-same  stamp  retains, 
And  is  as  wondrous  now  as  on  the  primal  day. 

Better  he  might  have  fared,  poor  wight, 

Hadst  thou  not  given  him  a  gleam  of  heavenly  light; 

Reason  he  names  it,  and  doth  so 

Use  it,  than  brutes  more  brutish  still  to  grow. 

With  deference  to  your  grace,  he  seems  to  me 
Like  any  long-legged  grasshopper  to  be, 

Which  ever  flies,  and  flying  springs, 

And  in  the  grass  its  ancient  ditty  sings. 

Would  he  but  always  in  the  grass  repose! 

In  every  heap  of  dung  he  thrusts  his  nose. 

THE  LORD. 

Hast  thou  naught  else  to  say?  Is  blame 
In  coming  here,  as  ever,  thy  sole  aim? 

Does  nothing  on  the  earth  to  thee  seem  right? 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

No,  Lord!  I  find  things  there  in  miserable  plight. 
Men’s  wretchedness  in  sooth  I  so  deplore. 

Not  even  I  would  plague  the  sorry  creatures  more.

THE  LORD. 

Right. 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

He  serves  thee  in  strange  fashion,  as  I  think. 

Poor  fool!  Not  earthly  is  his  food  or  drink. 

An  inward  impulse  hurries  him  afar,  60 

Himself  half-conscious  of  his  frenzied  mood; 

From  heaven  claimeth  he  its  brightest  star. 

And  from  the  earth  craves  every  highest  good. 

And  all  that’s  near,  and  all  that’s  far, 

Fails  to  allay  the  tumult  in  his  blood.  '  65 

THE  LORD. 

Though  now  he  serves  me  with  imperfect  sight, 

I  will  ere  long  conduct  him  to  the  light. 

The  gard’ner  knoweth,  when  the  green  appears, 

That  flowers  and  fruit  will  crown  the  coming  years. 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

What  wilt  thou  wager?  Him  thou  yet  shall  lose,  70 

If  leave  to  me  thou  wilt  but  give, 

Gently  to  lead  him  as  I  choose! 

THE  LORD. 

So  long  as  he  on  earth  doth  live. 

So  long  ’tis  not  forbidden  thee. 

Man  still  must  err,  while  he  doth  strive.  75 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

I  thank  you;  for  not  willingly 

I  traffic  with  the  dead,  and  still  aver 

That  youth’s  plump  blooming  cheek  I  very  much  prefer. 

I’m  not  at  home  to  corpses;  ’tis  my  way. 

Like  cats  with  captive  mice  to  toy  and  play.  80 

THE  LORD. 

Enough!  ’tis  granted  thee!  Divert 
This  mortal  spirit  from  his  primal  source; 

Him,  canst  thou  seize,  thy  power  exert

And  lead  him  on  thy  downward  course. 

Then  stand  abash'd,  when  thou  perforce  must  own,  85 
A  good  man,  in  the  direful  grasp  of  ill. 

His  consciousness  of  right  retaineth  still. 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

Agreed! — the  wager  will  be  quickly  won. 

For  my  success  no  fears  I  entertain; 

And  if  my  end  1  finally  should  gain,  90 

Excuse  my  triumphing  with  all  my  soul. 

Dust  he  shall  eat,  ay,  and  with  relish-  take. 

As  did  my  cousin,  the  renowned  snake. 

THE  LORD. 

Here  too  thou’rt  free  to  act  without  control; 

I  ne’er  have  cherished  hate  for  such  as  thee.  95 

Of  all  the  spirits  who  deny. 

The  scoffer  is  least  wearisome  to  me. 

Ever  too  prone  is  man  activity  to  shirk. 

In  unconditioned  rest  he  fain  would  live; 

Hence  this  companion  purposely  I  give,  100 

Who  stirs,  excites,  and  must,  as  devil,  work. 

But  ye,  the  genuine  sons  of  heaven,  rejoice! 

In  the  full  living  beauty  still  rejoice! 

May  that  which  works,  and  lives,  the  ever-growing, 

In  bonds  of  love  enfold  yon,  mercy-fraught,  105 

And  Seeming’s  changeful  forms,  around  you  flowing, 

Do  ye  arrest,  in  ever-during  thought! 

( Heaven  closes,  the  Archangels  disperse.) 

MEPHISTOPHELES  ( alone ). 

The  ancient  one  I  like  sometimes  to  see, 

And  not  to  break  with  him  am  always  civil; 

’Tis  courteous  in  so  great  a  lord  as  he. 

To  speak  so  kindly  even  to  the  devil.

This  in  my  heart  like  fire  doth  burn. 

’Tis  true.  I've  more  cunning  than  all  your  dull  tribe, 
Magister  and  doctor,  priest,  parson,  and  scribe; 
Scruple  or  doubt  come  not  to  enthrall  me, 

Neither  can  devil  nor  hell  now  appal  me — 

Hence  also  my  heart  must  all  pleasure  forego! 

I  may  not  pretend,  aught  rightly  to  know, 

I  may  not  pretend,  through  teaching,  to  find 
A  means  to  improve  or  convert  mankind. 

Then  I  have  neither  goods  nor  treasure. 

No  worldly  honor,  rank,  or  pleasure; 

No  dog  in  such  fashion  would  longer  live! 

Therefore  myself  to  magic  I  give. 

In  hope,  through  spirit-voice  and  might. 

Secrets  now  veiled  to  bring  to  light. 

That  I  no  more,  with  aching  brow, 

Need  speak  of  what  I  nothing  know; 

That  I  the  force  may  recognize

Their  last  upon  mine  anguish  gaze! 

Beside  this  desk,  at  dead  of  night. 

Oft  have  I  watched  to  hail  thy  light: 

Then,  pensive  friend!  o’er  book  and  scroll. 
With  soothing  power,  thy  radiance  stole! 

In  thy  dear  light,  ah,  might  I  climb. 
Freely,  some  mountain  height  sublime, 
Round  mountain  caves  with  spirits  ride. 

In  thy  mild  haze  o’er  meadows  glide. 

And,  purged  from  knowledge-fumes,  renew 
My  spirit,  in  thy  healing  dew! 

Woe’s  me!  still  prison’d  in  the  gloom 
Of  this  abhorr’d  and  musty  room, 

Where  heaven’s  dear  light  itself  doth  pass, 
But  dimly  through  the  painted  glass! 
Hemmed  in  by  volumes  thick  with  dust, 

A  prey  to  worms  and  moluering  rust, 

And  to  the  high  vault’s  topmost  bound. 
With  smoky  paper  compass’d  round; 

With  boxes  round  thee  piled,  and  glass, 
And  many  a  useless  instrument. 

With  old  ancestral  lumber  blent — - 
This  is  thy  world!  a  world!  alas! 

And  dost  thou  ask  why  heaves  thy  heart, 
With  tighten’d  pressure  in  thy  breast? 

Why  the  dull  ache  will  not  depart, 

By  which  thy  life-pulse  is  oppress’d? 

Instead  of  nature’s  living  sphere. 

Created  for  mankind  of  old, 

Brute  skeletons  surround  thee  here, 

And  dead  men’s  bones  in  smoke  and  mold.

Make  answer,  if  my  voice  ye  hear!

Ah!  at  this  spectacle  through  every  sense. 

What  sudden  ecstasy  of  joy  is  flowing! 

I  feel  new  rapture,  hallow’d  and  intense,  80 

Through  every  nerve  and  vein  with  ardor  glowing. 

Was  it  a  god  who  character’d  this  scroll. 

Which  doth  the  inward  tumult  still, 

The  troubled  heart  with  rapture  till, 

And  by  a  mystic  impulse,  to  my  soul,  85 

Unveils  the  working  of  the  wondrous  whole? 

Am  I  a  God?  What  light  intense! 

In  these  pure  symbols  do  I  see, 

Nature  exert  her  vital  energy. 

Now  of  the  wise  man’s  words  I  learn  the  sense;  90 

“  Unlock’d  the  spirit-world  doth  lie; 

Thy  sense  is  shut,. thy  heart  is  dead! 

Up  scholar,  lave,  with  courage  high, 

Thine  earthly  breast  in  the  morning-red!”

How  powers  celestial,  rising  and  descending, 

Their  golden  buckets  ceaseless  interchange! 

Their  flight  on  rapture-breathing  pinions  winging, 

From  heaven  to  earth  their  genial  influence  bringing,  100 
Through  the  wide  sphere  their  chimes  melodious  ringing! 

A  wondrous  show!  but  ah!  a  show  alone! 

Where  shall  1  grasp  thee,  infinite  nature,  where?

And  mid  the  crashing  shipwreck  not  despair. 

Clouds  gather  over  me—

Vapors  are  rising — Quiv’ring  round  my  head  120 

Flash  the  red  beams — Down  from  the  vaulted  roof 
A  shuddering  horror  floats.

Like  ministers  of  grace  they  oft  appear.

Ilis  master’s  track  to  find  once  more.

Dost  mark  how  round  us,  with  wide  spiral  curves, 

He  wheels,  each  circle  closer  than  before?  805 

And,  if  I  err  not,  he  appears  to  me 
A  fiery  whirlpool  in  his  track  to  leave.

Naught  but  a  poodle  black  of  hue  I  see; 

’Tis  some  illusion  doth  your  sight  deceive.

Methinks  a  magic  coil  our  feet  around,  810 

He  for  a  future  snare  doth  lightly  spread.

Come  hither,  Sirrah!  join  our  company!

A  very  poodle,  he  appears  to  be! 

Thou  standest  still,  for  thee  he’ll  wait;  820 

Thou  speak’st  to  him,  he  fawns  upon  thee  straight; 

Aught  you  may  lose,  again  he’ll  bring, 

And  for  your  stick  will  into  water  spring.

Thou’rt  right  indeed;  no  traces  now  I  see 

Whatever  of  a  spirit’s  agency.  825

With  feelings  of  foreboding  awe.

Pure  charity  doth  warm  the  breast,

My  softest  cushion  to  thee  I’ll  throw. 

As  thou,  without,  didst  please  and  amuse  me. 

Running  and  frisking  about  on  the  hill, 

Neither  shelter  will  I  refuse  thee; 

A  welcome  guest,  if  thou’lt  be  still.  845 

Ah!  when  within  our  narrow  room, 

The  friendly  lamp  again  doth  glow. 

An  inward  light  dispels  the  gloom 
In  hearts  that  strive  themselves  to  know. 

Reason  begins  again  to  speak,  850 

Again  the  bloom  of  hope  returns, 

The  stream  of  life  we  fain  would  seek. 

Ah,  for  life’s  source  our  spirit  yearns. 

Cease,  poodle,  cease!  witli  the  tone  that  arises. 

Hallow’d  and  peaceful,  my  soul  within, 

Accords  not  thy  growl,  thy  bestial  din. 

We  find  it  not  strange,  that  man  despises 
AVhat  he  conceives  not; 

The  good  and  the  fair  he  misprizes; 

What  lies  beyond  him  he  doth  contemn; 

Snarleth  the  poodle  at  it,  like  men? 

But  ah!  E’en  now  I  feel,  howe’er  I  yearn  for  rest, 
Contentment  welleth  up  no  longer  in  my  breast. 

Yet  wherefore  must  the  stream,  alas,  so  soon  be  dry. 

That  we  once  more  athirst  should  lie?  865 

This  sad  experience  oft  I’ve  approv’d! 

The  want  admitteth  of  compensation; 

We  learn  to  prize  what  from  sense  is  remov’d. 

Our  spirits  yearn  for  revelation. 

Which  nowhere  burneth  with  beauty  blent,  870 

More  pure  than  in  the  New  Testament. 

To  the  ancient  text  an  impulse  strong 
Moves  me  the  volume  to  explore. 

And  to  translate  its  sacred  lore, 

Into  the  tones  beloved  of  the  German  tongue.  875

’Tis  writ,  “In  the  beginning  was  the  Word!”

Lest  thy  too  hasty  pen  be  led  astray! 

Is  force  creative  then  of  Sense  the  dower? 

“  In  the  beginning  was  the  Power!”  885 

Thus  should  it  stand:  yet,  while  the  line  I  trace, 

A  something  warns  me,  once  more  to  efface. 

The  spirit  aids!  from  anxious  scruples  freed, 

I  write,  “In  the  beginning  was  the  Deed!”

Are  nature’s  laws  suspended  here?  900 

Eeal  is  it,  or  a  phantom  show? 

In  length  and  breadth  how  doth  my  poodle  grow! 

He  lifts  himself  with  threat’ning  mien. 

In  likeness  of  a  dog  no  longer  seen! 

What  specter  have  I  harbor’d  thus!  905 

Huge  as  a  hippopotamus, 

With  fiery  eye,  terrific  tooth! 

Ah!  now  I  know  thee,  sure  enough!

In  every  ear  that  ceaseless  rings.

Hoarsely  each  passing  moment  sings. 

But  to  new  horror  I  awake  each  morn, 

And  I  could  weep  hot  tears,  to  see  the  sun 
Dawn  on  another  day,  whose  round  forlorn 
Accomplishes  no  wish  of  mine — -not  one. 

Which  still,  with  Howard  captiousness,  impairs 
E’en  the  presentiment  of  every  joy, 

While  low  realities  and  paltry  cares 
The  spirit’s  fond  imaginings  destroy. 

And  must  I  then,  when  falls  the  veil  of  night.

Stretch’d  on  my  pallet  languish  in  despair; 

Appalling  dreams  my  soul  affright; 

No  rest  vouchsafed  me  even  there. 

The  god,  who  throned  within  my  breast  resides, 

Deep  in  my  soul  can  stir  the  springs;  1215 

With  sovereign  sway  my  energies  he  guides, 

He  cannot  move  external  things; 

And  so  existence  is  to  me  a  weight, 

Death  fondly  I  desire,  and  life  1  hate.

And  yet,  methinks,  by  most  Twill  be  confess’d  1220

The  blood-stain’d  wreath  in  conquest’s  dazzling  hour;

Dissolv’d  in  bliss,  in  love’s  delicious  bower!  1225

Enraptured,  I  had  rendered  up  my  soul!

With  the  sweet  harmonies  of  happier  days:  1235 

So  curse  I  all,  around  the  soul  that  windeth 
Its  magic  and  alluring  spell, 

And  with  delusive  flattery  bindeth 
Its  victim  to  this  dreary  cell!

Stagnate  sap  of  life  and  sense. 

Forbear  to  trifle  longer  with  thy  grief, 

Which,  vulture-like,  consumes  thee  in  this  den. 

The  worst  society  is  some  relief, 

Making  thee  feel  thyself  a  man  with  men.  1285 

Nathless  it  is  not  meant,  I  trow, 

To  thrust  thee  ’mid  the  vulgar  throng. 

I  to  the  upper  ranks  do  not  belong; 

Yet  if,  by  me  companion'd,  thou, 

Thy  steps  through  life  forthwith  wilt  take,  1290 

Upon  the  spot  myself  I’ll  make 
Thy  comrade — 

Should  it  suit  thy  need,

Kindness  to  any  one  to  show.

But  when  together  yonder  we  appear. 

Then  shalt  thou  do  the  same  for  me.  1305

But  small  concern  I  feel  for  yonder  world; 

Hast  thou  this  system  into  ruin  hurl’d. 

Another  may  arise  the  void  to  fill.

A  depth  below  or  height  above.

In  this  mood  thou  mayst  venture  it.  But  make 
The  compact,  and  at  once  I’ll  undertake 
To  charm  thee  with  mine  arts.  I’ll  give  thee  more 
Than  mortal  eye  hath  e’er  beheld  before.  1320 

FAUST. 

What,  sorry  Devil,  hast  thou  to  bestow? 

Was  ever  mortal  spirit,  in  its  high  endeavor. 

Fathom’d  by  Being  such  as  thou? 

Yet  food  thou  hast  which  satisfieth  never, 

Hast  ruddy  gold,  that  still  doth  flow 
Like  restless  quicksilver  away, 

A  game  thou  hast,  at  which  none  win  who  play, 

A  girl  who  would,  with  amorous  eyen, 

E’en  from  my  breast,  a  neighbor  snare. 

Lofty  ambition’s  joy  divine, 

That,  meteor-like,  dissolves  in  air. 

Show  me  the  fruit  that,  ere  ’tis  pluck’d,  doth  rot. 

And  trees,  whose  verdure  daily  buds  anew. 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

Such  a  commission  scares  me  not, 

I  can  provide  such  treasures,  it  is  true;  1335 

But,  my  good  friend,  a  season  will  come  round. 

When  on  what’s  good  we  may  regale  in  peace.

If  e’er  upon  my  couch,  stretched  at  my  ease,  I’m  found, 
Then  may  my  life  that  instant  cease; 

Me  canst  thou  cheat  with  glozing  wile  • 

Till  self-reproach  away  I  cast? —  1340

Then  to  the  abyss  will  I  depart; 

Then  may  the  solemn  death-bell  sound. 

Then  from  thy  service  thou  art  free, 

The  index  then  may  cease  its  round. 

And  time  be  nevermore  for  me!

Attend,  my  duties  to  commence.

A  writing,  Pedant!  dost  demand  from  me? 

Man,  and  man’s  plighted  word,  are  these  unknown  to  thee? 
Is’t  not  enough,  that  by  the  word  I  gave, 

My  doom  forevermore  is  cast?  1365 

Loth  not  the  world  in  all  its  currents  rave, 

And  must  a  promise  bold  me  fast? 

Yet  fixed  is  this  delusion  in  our  heart; 

Who,  of  his  own  free  will,  therefrom  would  part? 

How  blest  within  whose  breast  truth  reigneth  pure!  1370 
Yo  sacrifice  will  he  repenkwhen  made! 

A  formal  deed,  with  seal  and  signature, 

A  specter  this  from  which  all  shrink  afraid, 

The  word  its  life  resigneth  in  the  pen. 

Leather  and  wax  usurp  the  mastery  then.  1375

Vainly  I  have  aspired  too  high;  1390 

I’m  on  a  level  but  with  such  as  thou; 

Me  the  great  spirit  scorn’d,  defied; 

Nature  from  me  herself  doth  hide; 

Rent  is  the  web  of  thought;  my  mind 

Doth  knowledge  loath  of  every  kind.  1395 

In  depths  of  sensual  pleasure  drown’d. 

Let  us  our  fiery  passions  still! 

Enwrapp’d  in  magic’s  veil  profound.

Plunge  we  in  time’s  tempestuous  flow,  1400 

Stem  we  the  rolling  surge  of  chance! 

There  may  alternate  weal  and  woe. 

Success  and  failure,  as  they  can, 

Mingle  and  shift  in  changeful  dance! 

Excitement  is  the  sphere  for  man.  1405

Purg’d  from  the  love  of  knowledge,  my  vocation 
The  scope  of  all  my  powers  henceforth  be  this. 
To  bare  my  breast  to  every  pang— to  know 
In  my  heart’s  core  all  human  weal  and  woe. 

To  grasp  in  thought  the  lofty  and  the  deep. 
Men’s  various  fortunes  on  my  breast  to  heap, 
And  thus  to  theirs  dilate  my  individual  mind, 
And  share  at  length  with  them  the  shipwreck  of

Oh,  credit  me,  who  still  as  ages  roll, 

Have  chew’d  this  bitter  fare  from  year  to  year,

Digests  the  ancient  leaven!  Know,  this  Whole 
Doth  for  the  Deity  alone  subsist! 

He  in  eternal  brightness  doth  exist. 

Us  unto  darkness  he  hath  brought,  and  here 
Where  day  and  night  alternate,  is  your  sphere.

That  you  to  friendly  counsel  should  attend. 
A  poet  choose  as  your  ally! 

Let  him  thought’s  wide  dominion  sweep, 
Each  good  and  noble  quality, 

Upon  your  honored  brow  to  heap; 

The  lion’s  magnanimity. 

The  fleetness  of  the  hind. 

The  fiery  blood  of  Italy, 

The  Northern’s  steadfast  mind! 

Let  him  to  you  the  mystery  show 
To  blend  high  aims  and  cunning  low; 

And  while  youth’s  passions  are  aflame 
To  fall  in  love  by  rule  and  plan!

Then  will  your  mind  be  so  well  braced.

Unseen  the  threads  together  flow, 

A  thousand  knots  one  stroke  combines.

To  me  this  branch  of  science  is  well  known,  1615 

And  hence  I  cannot  your  repugnance  blame. 

Customs  and  laws  in  every  place. 

Like  a  disease,  an  heirloom  dread. 

Still  trail  their  curse  from  race  to  race. 

And  furtively  abroad  they  spread.  1620 

To  nonsense,  reason’s  self  they  turn; 

Beneficence  becomes  a  pest; 

Woe  unto  thee,  that  thouTt  a  grandson  born! 

As  for  the  law  born  with  us,  unexpressed; 

That  law,  alas!  none  careth  to  discern.  1625

But  as  regards  this  science,  you  will  find,  1630 

So  hard  it  is  to  shun  the  erring  way, 

And  so  much  hidden  poison  lies  therein. 

Which  scarce  can  you  discern  from  medicine. 

Here  too  it  is  the  best,  to  listen  but  to  one. 

And  by  the  master’s  words  to  swear  alone.  1635

Come,  quick,  and  let  thyself  be  led  by  me; 

Thou  must  perspire,  in  order  that  the  juice  2245 

Thy  frame  may  penetrate  through  every  part. 

Thy  noble  idleness  I’ll  teach  thee  then  to  prize. 

And  soon  with  ecstasy  thou’lt  recognize 
How  Cupid  stirs  and  gambols  in  thy  heart.

Too  lovely  was  that  female  form!

In  flesh  and  blood  ere  long  thou  shalt  survey.

I  am  no  lady,  am  not  fair, 

Can  without  escort  home  repair. 

{She  disengages  herself  and  exit.) 

FAUST. 

By  heaven!  This  girl  is  fair  indeed!  2260 

No  form  like  hers  can  I  recall. 

Virtue  she  hath,  and  modest  heed. 

Is  piquant  too,  and  sharp  withal. 

Her  cheek’s  soft  light,  her  rosy  lips. 

No  length  of  time  will  e’er  eclipse!  2265 

Her  downward  glance  in  passing  by. 

Deep  in  my  heart  is  stamp’d  for  aye; 

How  curt  and  sharp  her  answer  too, 

My  ravish’d  heart  to  rapture  grew! 

(Mephistopheles  enters.)

This  girl  must  win  for  me!  Dost  hear?  2270 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

Which? 

FAUST. 

She  who  but  now  passed. 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

What! 

She  from  confession  cometh  here. 

From  every  sin  absolved  and  free; 

I  crept  near  the  confessor’s  chair. 

All  innocence  her  virgin  soul, 

For  next  to  nothing  went  she  there; 

O’er  such  as  she  I’ve  no  control! 

FAUST. 

She’s  past  fourteen.

Like  any  gay  Lothario,

Sir  Moralizer,  prithee,  pause; 

Nor  plague  me  with  your  tiresome  laws!  2285 

To  cut  the  matter  short,  my  friend. 

She  must  this  very  night  be  mine — 

And  if  to  help  me  you  decline. 

Midnight  shall  see  our  compact  end.

A  fortnight's  space,  at  least,  I  need, 

A  fit  occasion  but  to  find.

With  but  seven  hours  I  could  succeed; 

Nor  should  I  want  the  devil’s  wile. 

So  young  a  creature  to  beguile.  2295 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

Like  any  Frenchman  now  you  speak. 

But  do  not  fret,  I  pray;  why  seek 
To  hurry  to  enjoyment  straight? 

The  pleasure  is  not  half  so  great. 

As  when  at  first,  around,  above,  2300 

With  all  the  fooleries  of  love. 

The  puppet  you  can  knead  and  mold 
As  in  Italian  story  oft  is  told.

No  such  incentives  do  I  need. 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

But  now,  without  offense  or  jest!  2305 

You  cannot  quickly,  I  protest, 

In  winning  this  sweet  child  succeed. 

By  storm  we  cannot  take  the  fort. 

To  stratagem  we  must  resort.

Will  lead  you  to  her  room  this  very  day.

And  shall  I  see  her? — Have  her?

No! 

She  to  a  neighbor’s  house  will  go; 

But  in  her  atmosphere  alone,  2320 

The  tedious  hours  meanwhile  you  may  employ. 

In  blissful  dreams  of  future  joy.

Of  treasure,  buried  long  before,

He  had  a  gallant  air.  I  trow,

Feeding  on  hope’s  sweet  dew  thy  blissful  pains! 

What  stillness  here  environs  me! 

Content  and  order  brood  around. 

What  fullness  in  this  poverty! 

In  this  small  cell  what  bliss  profound!  2345

How  oft  the  children  of  a  by  gone  race. 

Have  cluster’d  round  this  patriarchal  throne!

For  Christmas  gift,  with  grateful  joy  possess’d. 

Hath  with  the  full  round  cheek  of  childhood,  here. 

Her  grandsire’s  wither’d  hand  devoutly  press’d. 

Maiden!  I  feel  thy  spirit  haunt  the  place. 

Breathing  of  order  and  abounding  grace.  2355 

As  with  a  mother’s  voice  it  prompteth  thee. 

The  pure  white  cover  o’er  the  board  to  spread. 

To  strew  the  crisping  sand  beneath  thy  tread. 

Dear  hand!  so  godlike  in  its  ministry! 

The  hut  becomes  a  paradise  through  thee!  -  2360

How  thrills  my  pulse  with  strange  delight! 

Here  could  I  linger  hours  untold; 

Thou,  Nature,  didst  in  vision  bright, 

The  embryo  angel  here  unfold.  2365

What  wouldst  thou  here?  what  makes  thy  heart  so  sore? 
Unhappy  Faust!  I  know  thee  now  no  more. 

Do  I  a  magic  atmosphere  inhale? 

Erewhile,  my  passion  would  not  brook  delay!  2375 

Now  in  a  pure  love-dream  I  melt  away. 

Are  we  the  sport  of  every  passing  gale? 

Should  she  return  and  enter  now, 

How  wouldst  thou  rue  thy  guilty  flame! 

Proud  vaunter — thou  wouldst  hide  thy  brow —  2380 

And  at  her  feet  sink  down  with  shame.

Quick!  quick!  below  I  see  her  there!

Of  jewels,  which  I  got  elsewhere.  2385

Therein  some  trifles  I  have  placed. 

Wherewith  another  to  obtain.

Perchance  you  would  retain  the  treasure? 

If  such  your  wish,  why  then,  1  say, 

Henceforth  absolve  me  from  my  task, 

Nor  longer  waste  your  hours  of  leisure.

It  is  so  close,  so  sultry  now,

I’m  but  a  foolish  timid  thing!

There  was  a  king  in  Thule, 

True  even  to  the  grave; 

To  whom  his  dying  mistress 
A  golden  beaker  gave. 

At  every  feast  he  drained  it. 

Naught  was  to  him  so  dear. 

And  often  as  he  drained  it. 

Gush’d  from  his  eyes  the  tear. 

When  deatli  he  felt  approaching, 

His  cities  o’er  he  told; 

And  grudged  his  heir  no  treasure 
Except  his  cup  of  gold. 

Girt  round  with  knightly  vassals 
At  a  royal  feast  sat  he, 

In  yon  proud  hall  ancestral, 

In  his  castle  o’er  the  sea.

He  saw  it  splashing,  drinking, 

And  plunging  in  the  sea; 

His  eyes  meanwhile  were  sinking. 

And  never  again  drank  he.  2435

How  comes  this  lovely  casket  here?  The  press 
I  locked,  of  that  I’m  confident. 

’Tis  very  wonderful!  What’s  in  it  I  can’t  guess; 

Perhaps  ’twas  brought  by  some  one  in  distress, 

And  left  in  pledge  for  loan  my  mother  lent.  2440

I  have  a  mind  to  open  it  and  see! 

Heavens!  only  look!  what  have  we  here!

Jewels’  which  any  noble  dame  might  wear,  2445 

For  some  high  pageant  richly  diglit ! 

How  would  the  necklace  look  on  me! 

These  splendid  gems,  whose  may  they  be?

Were  but  the  ear-rings  only  mine!

Just  think!  The  gems  for  Gretchen  brought, 

Them  hath  a  priest  now  made  his  own! — 

A  glimpse  of  them  the  mother  caught, 

And  ’gan  with  secret  fear  to  groan. 

The  woman’s  scent  is  keen  enough;  2470 

Doth  ever  in  the  prayer-book  snuff ; 

Smells  every  article  to  ascertain 
Whether  the  thing  is  holy  or  profane. 

And  scented  in  the  jewels  rare. 

That  there  was  not  much  blessing  there.  2475 

“  My  child,”  she  cries,  “ill-gotten  good 
Ensnares  the  soul,  consumes  the  blood; 

With  them  we’ll  deck  our  Lady’s  shrine. 

She’ll  cheer  our  souls  with  bread  divine!” 

At  this  poor  Gretchen  ’gan  to  pout;  2480 

’Tis  a  gift-horse,  at  least,  she  thought. 

And  sure,  he  godless  cannot  be, 

•  Who  brought  them  here  so  cleverly. 

Straight  for  a  priest  the  mother  sent. 

Who,  when  he  understood  the  jest,  2485 

With  what  he  saw  was  well  content. 

“  This  shows  a  pious  mind!”  Quoth  he: 

“  Self-conquest  is  true  victory. 

The  Church  hath  a  good  stomach,  she,  with  zest, 

Hath  lands  and  kingdoms  swallow’d  down,  2490

Something  less  foul  it  was  than  dung;  2605 

’Twas  straw  half  rotten;  yet,  he  as  a  Christian  died. 

And  sorely  hath  remorse  his  conscience  wrung. 

“  Wretch  that  I  was,”  quoth  he,  with  parting  breath, 

“  So  to  forsake  my  business  and  my  wife!

Ah!  the  remembrance  is  my  death.  2610 

Could  I  but  have  her  pardon  in  this  life!" — 

martha  (■ weeping ). 

Dear  soul!  I’ve  long  forgiven  him  indeed! 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

“  Though  she,  God  knows,  was  more  to  blame  than  I." 

MARTHA. 

What,  on  the  brink  of  death  assert  a  lie! 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

If  I  am  skill’d  the  countenance  to  read. 

He  doubtless  fabled  as  he  parted  hence. 

“No  time  had  I  to  gape,  or  take  my  ease,’’  he  said, 

“  First  to  get  children,  and  then  get  them  bread; 

And  bread,  too,  in  the  very  widest  sense; 

Nor  could  I  eat  in  peace  even  my  proper  share.’’ 

MARTHA. 

What,  all  my  truth,  my  love  forgotten  quite? 

My  weary  drudgery  by  day  and  night! 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

Not  so!  He  thought  of  you  with  tender  care. 

Quoth  he:  “Heaven  knows  how  fervently  I  prayed, 

For  wife  and  children  when  from  Malta  bound;  2625 
The  prayer  hath  heaven  with  favor  crowned; 

We  took  a  Turkish  vessel  which  conveyed 
Eich  store  of  treasure  for  the  Sultan’s  court; 

Its  own  reward  our  gallant  action  brought; 

The  captur’d  prize  was  shared  among  the  crew,  263^ 

And  of  the  treasure  I  received  my  due.’’ 

MARTHA. 

How?  Where?  The  treasure  hath  he  buried,  pray? 
MEPHISTOPHELES. 

Where  the  four  winds  have  blown  it,  who  can  say? 

In  Naples  as  he  stroll’d,  a  stranger  there — 

A  comely  maid  took  pity  on  my  friend; 

And  gave  such  tokens  of  her  love  and  care, 

That  he  retained  them  to  his  blessed  end.

MARTHA. 

Scoundrel!  to  rob  bis  children  of  their  bread! 

And  all  this  misery,  this  bitter  need. 

Could  not  his  course  of  recklessness  impede! 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

Well,  he  hath  paid  the  forfeit,  and  is  dead. 

Now  were  I  in  your  place,  my  counsel  hear; 

My  weeds  I’d  wear  for  one  chaste  year. 

And  for  another  lover  meanwhile  would  lookout. 

MARTHA. 

Alas!  I  might  search  far  and  near. 

Not  quickly  should  I  find  another  like  my  first! 
There  could  not  be  a  fonder  fool  than  mine, 

Only  he  loved  too  well  abroad  to  roam; 

Loved  foreign  women  too,  and  foreign  wine. 

And  loved  besides  the  dice  accurs’d. 

MEPHISTOPHELES, 

All  had  gone  swimmingly,  no  doubt, 

Had  he  but  given  you  at  home. 

On  his  side  just  as  wide  a  range. 

Upon  such  terms,  to  you  I  swear. 

Myself  with  you  would  gladly  rings  exchange!

Farewell ! 

MARTHA. 

But  ere  you  leave  us,  quickly  tell ! 

I  from  a  witness  faiu  had  heard. 

Where,  how,  and  when  my  husband  died  and  was  inter r’d. 
To  forms  I’ve  always  been  attached  indeed, 

His  death  I  fain  would  in  the  journals  read.  2665 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

Ay,  madam,  what  two  witnesses  declare 
Is  held  as  valid  everywhere; 

A  gallant  friend  I  have,  not  far  from  here. 

Who  will  for  you  before  the  judge  appear. 

I’ll  bring  him  straight. 

MARTHA. 

I  pray  you  do  !  2670 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

And  this  young  lady,  we  shall  find  her  too? 

A  noble  youth,  far  traveled  he. 

Shows  to  the  sex  all  courtesy. 

MARGARET. 

I  in  his  presence  needs  must  blush  for  shame. 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

Not  in  the  presence  of  a  crowned  king  !  2675

There  we’ll  await  you  both  this  evening.

Bravo  !  I  find  you  all  aflame!

This  eve,  at  neighbor  Martha’s,  her  you’ll  meet  again;

The  woman  seems  expressly  made 
To  drive  the  pimp  and  gypsy’s  trade. 

FAUST. 

Good! 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

But  from  us  she  something  would  request. 

FAUST. 

A  favor  claims  return  as  this  world  goes.  2685 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

We  have  on  oath  but  duly  to  attest, 

That  her  dead  husband’s  limbs,  outstretch’d,  repose 
In  holy  ground  at  Padua. 

FAUST. 

Sage  indeed  : 

So  I  suppose  we  straight  must  journey  there  ! 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

Sancta  simplicitas  !  For  that  no  need  !  2690 

Without  much  knowledge  we  have  but  to  swear. 

FAUST. 

If  you  have  nothing  better  to  suggest. 

Against  your  plan  I  must  at  once  protest. 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

Oh,  holy  man!  methinks  I  have  you  there! 

In  all  your  life  say,  have  you  ue’er  2695 

False  witness  borne,  until  this  hour? 

Have  you  of  God,  the  world,  and  all  it  doth  contain, 

Of  man,  and  that  which  worketh  in  his  heart  and  brain, 
Not  definitions  given,  in  words  of  weight  and  power, 

With  front  unblushing,  and  a  dauntless  breast?  2700 
Yet,  if  into  the  depth  of  things  you  go, 

Touching  these  matters,  it  must  be  confess’d, 

As  much  as  of  Herr  Schwerdtlein’s  death  you  know! 

FAUST. 

Thou  art  and  dost  remain  liar  and  sophist  too. 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

Ay,  if  one  did  not  take  a  somewhat  deeper  view!  2705

To-morrow,  in  all  honor,  thou 
Poor  Gretchen  wilt  befool,  and  vow 
Thy  soul’s  deep  love,  in  lover’s  fashion.

And  from  my  heart. 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

All  good  and  fair! 

Then  deathless  constancy  tbou’lt  swear;  2710 

Speak  of  one  all-o’ermastering  passion, — 

Will  that  too  issue  from  the  heart? 

FAUST. 

Forbear! 

When  passion  sways  me,  and  I  seek  to  frame 
Fit  utterance  for  feeling,  deep,  intense, 

And  for  my  frenzy  finding  no  fit  name,  2715 

Sweep  round  the  ample  world  with  every  sense. 

Grasp  at  the  loftiest  words  to  speak  my  flame. 

And  call  the  glow,  wherewith  I  burn. 

Quenchless,  eternal,  yea,  eterne — • 

Is  that  of  sophistry  a  devilish  play?  2720 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

Yet  am  I  right! 

FAUST. 

Mark  this,  my  friend, 

And  spare  my  lungs:  whoe’er  to  have  the  right  is  fain, 

If  he  have  but  a  tongue,  wherewith  his  point  to  gain. 

Will  gain  it  in  the  end. 

But  come,  of  gossip  I  am  weary  quite;  2725 

Because  I’ve  no  resource,  thou’rt  in  the  right.

Still  makes  the  best  of  things;  I  know  2730 

Too  well,  my  humble  prattle  never  can 
Have  power  to  entertain  so  wise  a  man. 

FAUST. 

One  glance,  one  word  of  thine  doth  charm  me  more. 

Than  the  world’s  wisdom  or  the  sage’s  lore. 

(He  kisses  her  hand.) 

MARGARET. 

Nay!  trouble  not  yourself!  A  hand  so  coarse,  2735 

So  rude  as  mine,  now  can  you  kiss! 

What  constant  work  at  home  must  I  not  do  perforce! 

My  mother  too  exacting  is. 

( They  pass  on.) 

MARTHA. 

Thus,  sir,  unceasing  travel  is  your  lot? 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

Traffic  and  duty  urge  us!  With  what  pain  2740 

Are  we  compelled  to  leave  full  many  a  spot, 

Where  yet  we  dare  not  once  remain! 

MARTHA. 

In  youth’s  wild  years,  with  vigor  crown’d, 

’Tis  not  amiss  thus  through  the  world  to  sweep; 

But  ah,  t lie  evil  days  come  round!  2745 

And  to  a  lonely  grave  as  bachelor  to  creep, 

A  pleasant  thing  has  no  one  found.

The  prospect  fills  me  with  dismay. 

MARTHA. 

Therefore  in  time,  dear  sir,  reflect,  I  pray.

Ay,  out  of  sight  is  out  of  mind  !

Trust  me,  my  angel,  what  doth  pass  for  sense

Simplicity  and  holy  innocence, — 

When  will  ye  learn  your  hollow’d  worth  to  know  1 
Ah,  when  will  meekness  and  humility. 

Kind  and  all-bounteous  nature’s  loftiest  dower — 

MARGARET. 

Only  one  little  moment  think  of  me  !  2760 

To  think  of  you  I  shall  have  many  an  hour. 

FAUST. 

You  are  perhaps  much  alone? 

MARGARET. 

Yes,  small  our  household  is,  I  own. 

Yet  must  I  see  to  it.  No  maid  we  keep. 

And  I  must  cook,  sew,  knit,  and  sweep,  2765 

Still  early  on  my  feet  and  late; 

My  mother  is  in  all  things,  great  and  small, 

So  accurate! 

Not  that  for  thrift  there  is  such  pressing  need; 

Than  others  we  might  make  more  show  indeed;  2770 
My  father  left  behind  a  small  estate, 

A  house  and  garden  near  the  city  wall. 

Quite  enough  my  life  has  been  of  late; 

My  brother  for  a  soldier’s  gone; 

My  little  sister’s  dead;  the  babe  to  rear  2775 

Occasion’d  me  some  care  and  fond  annoy; 

But  I  would  go  through  all  again  with  joy. 

The  darling  was  to  me  so  dear. 

FAUST. 

An  angel  sweet  if  it  resembled  thee! 

MARGARET. 

I  reared  it  up  and  it  grew  fond  of  me. 

After  my  father’s  death  it  saw  the  day; 


2780 


110 


FA  UST. 


We  gave  my  mother  up  for  lost,  she  lay 
In  such  a  wretched  plight,  and  then  at  length 
So  very  slowly  she  regain’d  her  strength. 

Weak  as  she  was,  ’twas  vain  for  her  to  try 
Herself  to  suckle  the  poor  babe,  so  I 
Reared  it  on  milk-and-water  all  alone; 

And  thus  the  child  became  as  'twere  my  own; 

Within  my  arms  it  stretched  itself  and  grew. 

And  smiling,  nestled  in  my  bosom  too. 

FAUST. 

Doubtless  the  purest  happiness  was  thine. 

MARGARET. 

But  many  weary  hours,  in  sooth,  were  also  mine. 

At  night  its  little  cradle  stood 
Close  to  my  bed;  so  was  I  wide  awake 
If  it  but  stirred;  2795 

One  while  I  was  obliged  to  give  it  food, 

Or  to  my  arms  the  darling  take; 

From  bed  full  oft  must  rise,  whene’er  its  cry  I  heard, 

And,  dancing  it,  must  pace  the  chamber  to  and  fro; 

Stand  at  the  wash-tub  early;  forthwith  go  2800 

To  market,  and  then  mind  the  cooking  too — 

To-morrow  like  to-day,  the  whole  year  through. 

Ah,  sir,  thus  living,  it  must  be  confess’d 
One’s  spirits  are  not  always  of  the  best; 

Yet  it  a  relish  gives  to  food  and  rest.  (They pass  on.) 

MARTHA. 

Poor  women!  we  are  badly  off,  I  own;  2806 

A  bachelor’s  conversion’s  hard  indeed! 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

Madam,  with  one  like  you  it  rests  alone. 

To  tutor  me  a  better  course  to  lead. 

MARTHA. 

Speak  frankly,  sir,  none  is  there  you  have  met?  2810 
Has  your  heart  ne’er  attached  itself  as  yet? 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

One’s  own  fireside  and  a  good  wife  are  gold 
And  pearls  of  price,  so  says  the  proverb  old.

Yet  hath  your  heart  no  earnest  preference  known? 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

With  ladies  one  should  ne’er  presume  to  jest.

Ah!  you  mistake! 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

I’m  sorry  I’m  so  blind! 

But  this  I  know — that  you  are  very  kind.

Me,  little  angel,  didst  thou  recognize,  2820 

When  in  the  garden  first  I  came? 

MARGARET. 

Did  you  not  see  it?  I  cast  down  my  eyes. 

FAUST. 

Thou  dost  forgive  my  boldness,  dost  not  blame 
The  liberty  I  took  that  day. 

When  thou  from  church  didst  lately  wend  thy  way?  2825 

MARGARET. 

I  was  confused.  So  had  it  never  been; 

No  one  of  me  could  any  evil  say. 

Alas!  thought  I,  he  doubtless  in  thy  mien, 

Something  unmaidenly  or  bold  hath  seen? 

It  seemed  as  if  it  struck  him  suddenly,  2830 

Here’s  just  a  girl  with  whom  one  may  make  free! 

Yet  I  must  own  that  then  I  scarcelv  knew 
What  in  your  favor  here  began  at  once  to  plead; 

Yet  I  was  angry  with  myself  indeed, 

That  I  more  angry  could  not  feel  with  you.  2835

Spirit  sublime!  Thou  gav’st  me,  gav’st  me  all  2875 

For  which  I  prayed!  Not  vainly  hast  thou  turn’d 
To  tne  thy  countenance  in  darning  bre: 

Gavest  me  glorious  nature  for  my  realm, 

And  also  power  to  feel  her  and  enjoy; 

Not  merely  with  a  cold  and  wondering  glance,  2880 

Thou  dost  permit  me  in  her  depths  profound. 

As  in  the  bosom  of  a  friend  to  gaze. 

Before  me  thou  dost  lead  her  living  tribes. 

And  dost  in  silent  grove,  in  air  and  stream 

Teach  me  to  know  my  kindred.  And  when  roars  2885 

The  howling  storm-blast  through  the  groaning  wood. 

Wrenching  the  giant  pine,  which  in  its  fall 

Crashing  sweeps  down  its  neighbor  trunks  and  boughs, 

While  with  the  hollow  noise  the  hill  resounds: 

Then  thou  dost  lead  me  to  some  shelter’d  cave,  2890 
Dost  there  reveal  me  to  myself,  and  show 
Of  my  own  bosom  the  mysterious  depths. 

And  when  with  soothing  beam,  the  moon’s  pale  orb 
Full  in  my  view  climbs  up  the  pathless  sky, 

From  crag  and  dewy  grove,  the  silvery  forms  2895 

Of  by-gone  ages  hover,  and  assauge 

The  joy  austere  of  contemplative  thought. 

Oh,  that  naught  perfect  is  assign’d  to  man, 

I  feel,  alas!  With  this  exalted  joy, 

Which  lifts  me  near  and  nearer  to  the  gods,  2900 

Thou  gav’st  me  this  companion,  unto  whom 
I  needs  must  cling,  though  cold  and  insolent. 

He  still  degrades  me  to  myself,  and  turns 
Thy  glorious  gifts  to  nothing,  with  a  breath. 

He  in  my  bosom  with  malicious  zeal  2905 

For  that  fair  image  fans  a  raging  bre; 

From  craving  to  enjoyment  thus  I  reel. 

And  in  enjoyment  languish  for  desire.

A  serious  tone  you  hardly  dare  employ. 

To  part  from  one  so  crazy,  harsh  and  cross, 

I  should  not  find  a  grievous  loss. 

The  livelong  day,  for  you  I  toil  and  fret; 

Ne’er  from  his  worship’s  face  a  hint  I  get; 

What  pleases  him,  or  what  to  let  alone.

Ay  truly!  that  is  just  the  proper  tone! 

He  wearies  me,  and  would  with  thanks  be  paid!

Poor  Son  of  Earth,  without  my  aid, 

How  would  thy  weary  days  have  flown?  2925 

Thee  of  thy  foolish  whims  I’ve  cured. 

Thy  vain  imaginations  banished, 

And  but  for  me,  be  well  assured. 

Thou  from  this  sphere  must  soon  have  vanished. 

In  rocky  hollows  and  in  caverns  drear,  2930 

Why  like  an  owl  sit  moping  here? 

Wherefore  from  dripping  stones  and  moss  with  ooze 
imbued, 

Dost  suck,  like  any  toad,  thy  food? 

A  rare,  sweet  pastime.  Verily! 

The  doctor  cleaveth  still  to  thee.  2935

Dost  comprehend  what  bliss  without  alloy 
From  this  wild  wand’ring  in  the  desert  springs? — 

Couldst  thou  but  guess  the  new  life-power  it  brings. 

Thou  wouldst  be  fiend  enough  to  envy  me  my  joy.

Embracing  heaven  and  earth  in  rapture  high. 

The  soul  dilating  to  a  deity; 

With  prescient  yearnings  pierce  the  core  of  earth, 

Feel  in  your  laboring  breast  the  six-days'  birth,  2945 

Enjoy,  in  proud  delight  what.no  one  knows. 

While  your  love-rapture  o’er  creation  flows, — 

The  earthly  lost  in  beatific  vision. 

And  then  the  lofty  intuition — 

{with  a  gesture.) 

I  need  not  tell  you  how — to  close!  2950

Fie  on  you! 

MEPHISTOPHELES. 

This  displeases  you  ?  “  For  shame!  ” 

You  are  forsooth  entitled  to  exclaim; 

We  to  chaste  ears  it  seems  must  not  pronounce 
What,  nathless,  the  chaste  heart  cannot  renounce. 

Well,  to  be  brief,  the  joy  as  fit  occasions  rise,  2955 

I  grudge  you  not,  of  specious  lies. 

But  soon  the  self-deluding  vein 
Is  past,  once  more  thou’rt  whirled  away. 

And  should  it  last,  thou’lt  be  the  prey 

Of  frenzy  or  remorse  and  pain.  2960 

Enough  of  this!  Thy  true  love  dwells  apart. 

And  all  to  her  seems  flat  and  tame; 

Alone  thine  image  fills  her  heart, 

She  loves  thee  with  an  all-devouring  flame. 

First  came  thy  passion  with  o’erpowering  rush,  2965 

Like  mountain  torrent,  swollen  by  the  melted  snow; 

Full  in  her  heart  didst  pour  the  sudden  gush. 

Now  has  thy  brooklet  ceased  to  flow. 

Instead  of  sitting  throned  midst  forests  wild, 

It  would  become  so  great  a  lord  2970 

To  comfort  the  enamor’d  child, 

And  the  young  monkey  for  her  love  reward. 

To  her  the  hours  seem  miserably  long; 

She  from  the  window  sees  the  clouds  float  by 
As  o’er  the  lofty  city  walls  they  fly. 

“  If  I  a  birdie  were!  ”  so  runs  her  song, 

Half  through  the  night  and  all  day  long.

The  Alpine  slope,  beside  the  waters  wild, 

Her  homely  cares  in  that  small  world  embraced. 

Secluded  lived,  a  simple  artless  child. 

Was’t  not  enough,  in  thy  delirious  whirl 

To  blast  the  steadfast  rocks;  3015 

Her,  and  her  peace  as  well, 

Must  I,  God-hated  one,  to  ruin  hurl! 

Dost  claim  this  holocaust,  remorseless  Hell! 

Fiend,  help  me  to  cut  short  the  hours  of  dread! 

Let  what  must  happen,  happen  speedily!  3020

How  is  it  with  religion  in  thy  mind? 

Thou  art  a  dear  kind-hearted  man, 

But  I’m  afraid  not  piously  inclined. 

FAUST. 

Forbear!  Thou  feelest  I  love  thee  alone;  3075 

For  those  I  love,  my  life  I  would  lay  down. 

And  none  would  of  their  faith  or  church  bereave.

That’s  not  enough,  we  must  ourselves  believe  !

Ah,  could  I  but  thy  soul  inspire! 

Thou  honorest  not  the  sacraments,  alas!  3080

But  yet  without  desire; 

’Tis  long  since  thou  hast  been  either  to  shrift  or  mass. 

Host  thou  believe  in  God?

Yes,  I  in  God  believe? 

Question  or  priest  or  sage,  and  they  3085 

Seem,  in  the  answer  you  receive.

Holds  and  sustains  he  not 
Thee,  me,  himself? 

Lifts  not  the  Heaven  its  dome  above? 

Doth  not  the  firm-set  earth  beneath  us  lie?  3100 

And  beaming  tenderly  with  looks  of  love, 

Climb  not  the  everlasting  stars  on  high? 

Do  I  not  gaze  into  thine  eyes? 

Nature’s  impenetrable  agencies, 

Are  they  not  thronging  on  thy  heart  and  brain,  3105 

Viewless,  or  visible  to  mortal  ken. 

Around  thee  weaving  their  mysterious  chain? 

Fill  thence  thy  heart,  how  large  soe’er  it  be; 

And  in  the  feeling  when  thou  utterly  art  blest, 

Then  call  it,  what  thou  wilt, —  3110 

Call  it  Bliss!  Heart!  Love!  God! 

I  have  no  name  for  it!

Only  in  slightly  different  phrase.

Beneath  Heaven’s  sunshine,  everywhere, 

This  is  the  utterance  of  the  human  heart;  312u 

Each  in  his  language  doth  the  like  impart; 

Then  why  not  1  in  mine?

What  thus  I  hear 

Sounds  plausible,  yet  I’m  not  reconciled; 

There’s  something  wrong  about  it;  much  I  fear 
That  thou  art  not  a  Christian.

Alas!  it  long  hath  sorely  troubled  me. 

To  see  thee  in  such  odious  company. 

FAUST. 

How  so? 

MARGARET. 

The  man  who  comes  with  thee,  I  hate, 

Yea,  in  my  spirit’s  inmost  depths  abhor; 

As  his  loath’d  visage,  in  my  life  before,  3130 

Naught  to  my  heart  e’er  gave  a  pang  so  great. 

FAUST. 

Fear  not,  sweet  love! 

MARGARET. 

His  presence  chills  my  blood. 
Toward  all  beside  I  have  a  kindly  mood; 

Yet,  though  I  yearn  to  gaze  on  thee,  I  feel 

At  sight  of  him  strange  horrors  o’er  me  steal;  3135 

That  lie’s  a  villain  my  conviction’s  strong. 

May  Heaven  forgive  me,  if  I  do  him  wrong!

Yet  such  strange  fellows  in  the  world  must  be! 

MARGARET. 

I  would  not  live  with  such  a  one  as  he. 

If  for  a  moment  he  but  enter  here,  3140 

He  looks  around  him  with  a  mocking  sneer. 

And  malice  ill-conceal’d; 

That  he,  with  naught  on  earth  can  sympathize  is  clear; 
Upon  his  brow  ’tis  legibly  revealed, 

That  to  his  heart  no  living  soul  is  dear;  3145 

So  blest  I  feel,  within  thine  arms. 

So  warm  and  happy — free  from  all  alarms; 

And  still  my  heart  doth  close  when  he  comes  near.

It  so  o’ermasters  me,  that  when. 

Or  wheresoe’er,  his  step  I  hear, 

I  almost  think,  no  more  I  love  thee  then. 

Besides,  when  he  is  near,  I  ne’er  could  pray, 

This  eats  into  my  heart;  with  thee 
The  same,  my  Henry,  it  must  be. 

FAUST. 

This  is  antipathy! 

MARGARET. 

I  must  away. 

FAUST. 

For  one  brief  hour  then  may  I  never  rest. 

And  heart  to  heart,  and  soul  to  soul  be  pressed? 

MARGARET. 

Ah,  if  I  slept  alone,  to-night 
The  bolt  I  fain  would  leave  undrawn  for  thee;  3160 

But  then  my  mother’s  sleep  is  light, 

Were  we  surprised  by  her,  ah  me! 

Upon  the  spot  I  should  be  dead. 

FAUST. 

Dear  angel!  there’s  no  cause  for  dread. 

Here  is  a  little  vial — if  she  take  3165 

Mixed  in  her  drink  three  drops,  ’twill  steep 
Her  nature  in  a  deep  and  soothing  sleep. 

MARGARET. 

What  do  I  not  for  thy  dear  sake! 

To  her  it  will  not  harmful  prove? 

FAUST. 

Should  I  advise  else,  sweet  love?  3170 

MARGARET. 

I  know  not,  dearest,  when  thy  face  I  see, 

What  doth  my  spirit  to  thy  will  constrain; 

Already  I  have  done  so  much  for  thee, 

That  scarcely  more  to  do  doth  now  remain.

Its  beams  the  ever-burning  taper  throws, 

AVhile  ever  waning,  fades  the  glimmering  light, 

As  gathering  darkness  doth  around  it  close! 

So  night-like  gloom  doth  in  my  bosom  reign.

I’m  like  a  tom-cat  in  a  thievish  vein,  3310 

That  up  fire-ladders  tall  and  steep, 

And  round  the  walls  doth  slyly  creep; 

Virtuous  withal,  I  feel,  with,  I  confess, 

A  touch  of  thievish  joy  and  wantonness.

By  stealth  thou  dost  begin  with  one, 

Others  will  follow  him  anon; 

And  when  a  dozen  thee  have  known, 

Thou’lt  common  be  to  all  the  town. 

When  infamy  is  newly  born, 

In  secret  she  is  brought  to  light, 

And  the  mysterious  veil  of  night 
O’er  head  and  ears  is  drawn; 

The  loathsome  birth  men  fain  would  slay; 
But  soon,  full  grown,  she  waxes  bold. 

And  though  not  fairer  to  behold. 

With  brazen  front  insults  the  day: 

The  more  abhorrent  to  the  sight. 

The  more  she  courts  the  day’s  pure  light. 

The  time  already  I  discern, 

When  thee  all  honest  folk  will  spurn. 

And  shun  thy  hated  form  to  meet. 

As  when  a  corpse  infects  the  street. 

Thy  heart  will  sink  in  blank  despair, 

When  they  shall  look  thee  in  the  face! 

A  golden  chain  no  more  thou’lt  wear— 

Nor  near  the  altar  take  in  church  thy  place — 

In  fair  lace  collar  simply  dight 

Thou’lt  dance  no  more  with  spirits  light — 

In  darksome  corners  thou  wilt  bide, 

Where  beggars  vile  and  cripples  hide — 

And  e’en  though  God  thy  crime  forgive, 

On  earth,  a  thing  accursed,  thou’lt  live!

While  fresh  upon  my  legs,  so  long  I  naught  require. 
Except  this  knotty  staff.  Besides, 

What  boots  it  to  abridge  a  pleasant  way?  3495 

Along  the  labyrinth  of  these  vales  to  creep, 

Then  scale  these  rocks,  whence,  in  eternal  spray, 

Adown  the  cliffs  the  silvery  fountains  leap: 

Such  is  the  joy  that  seasons  paths  like  these! 

Spring  weaves  already  in  the  birchen  trees;  3500 

E’en  the  late  pine-grove  feels  her  quickening  powers; 
Should  she  not  work  within  these  limbs  of  ours?

Naught  of  this  genial  influence  do  I  know! 

Within  me  all  is  wintry.  Frost  and  snow

Rises  the  ruddy,  moon’s  imperfect  round, 

Shedding  so  faint  a  light  at  every  tread 
One’s  sure  to  stumble  ’gainst  a  rock  or  tree!

Yonder  one  burning  merrily,  I  see.

A  custom  ’tis  of  ancient  date,  3700 

Our  lesser  worlds  within  the  great  world  to  create! 

Young  witches  there  I  see,  naked  and  bare. 

And  old  ones,  veil’d  more  prudently. 

For  my  sake  only  courteous  be! 

The  trouble’s  small,  the  sport  is  rare.  3705 

Of  instruments  I  hear  the  cursed  din — - 
One  must  get  used  to  it.  Come  in!  come  in! 

There’s  now  no  help  for  it.  I’ll  step  before. 

And  introducing  you  as  my  good  friend, 

Confer  on  you  one  obligation  more.  3710 

How  say  you  now?  ’Tis  no  such  paltry  room; 

Why  only  look,  you  scarce  can  see  the  end. 

A  hundred  fires  in  rows  disperse  the  gloom; 

They  dance,  they  talk,  they  cook,  make  love  and  drink: 
Where  could  we  find  aught  better,  do  you  think?  3715

As  devil  or  as  wizard  to  appear?

Nath  less  the  cloven  foot  doth  here  give  dignity. 

Seest  thou  yonder  snail?  Crawling  this  way  she  hies; 
With  searching  feelers,  she,  no  doubt. 

Hath  me  already  scented  out; 

Here,  even  if  I  would,  for  me  there’s  no  disguise.  3725 
From  fire  to  fire,  we’ll  saunter  at  our  leisure.

On  earth,  for  ’mong  my  store  there’s  naught,

No  dagger  here,  which  hath  not  flowed  with  blood,  37G0 
No  bowl,  which  hath  not  poured  into  some  healthy  frame 
Hot  poison’s  life-consuming  flood, 

No  trinket,  but  hath  wrought  some  woman’s  shame. 

No  weapon  but  hath  cut  some  sacred  tie,

Oh!  He  must  everywhere  appear. 

He  must  adjudge,  when  others  dance; 

If  on  each  step  his  say’s  not  said, 

So  is  that  step  as  good  as  never  made.

to  roll  before  the  feet  of  the  harmless  wanderer,  and  to 
fasten  on  his  shoulders  when  he  fell!  Change  him  again 
into  his  favorite  shape,  that  he  may  crouch  on  his  belly 
before  me  in  the  dust,  while  I  spurn  him  with  my  foot,  the 
reprobate!  Not  the  first!  Woe!  Woe!  By  no  human 
soul  is  it  conceivable,  that  more  than  one  human  creature 
has  ever  sunk  into  a  depth  of  wretchedness  like  this,  or 
that  the  first  in  her  writhing  death-agony,  should  not  have 
atoned  in  the  sight  of  all-pardoning  Heaven,  for  the  guilt 
of  all  the  rest!  The  misery  of  this  one  pierces  me  to  the 
very  marrow,  and  harrows  up  my  soul;  thou  art  grinning 
calmly  over  the  doom  of  thousands!  4082

Now  we  are  once  again  at  our  wit’s  end,  just  where  the

lowship,  if  thou  canst  not  go  through  with  it?  Wilt  fly, 
and  art  not  proof  against  dizziness?  Did  we  force  our¬ 
selves  on  thee,  or  thou  on  us?  4087

Cease  thus  to  gnash  thy  ravenous  fangs  at  me!  I  loath 
thee!  Great  and  glorious  spirit,  thou  who  didst  vouchsafe 
to  reveal  thyself  unto  me,  thou  who  dost  know  my  very 
heart  and  soul,  why  hast  thou  linked  me  with  this  base 
associate,  who  feeds  on  mischief  and  revels  in  destruc¬ 
tion?

And  the  danger  to  which  thou  dost  expose  thyself? 

Know,  the  guilt  of  blood,  shed  by  thy  hand,  lies  yet  upon 
the  town.  Over  the  place  where  fell  the  murdered  one, 
avenging  spirits  hover  and  watch  for  the  returning  mur¬ 
derer.  4109 

FAUST. 

This  too  from  thee?  The  death  and  downfall  of  a  world 
be  on  thee,  monster!  Conduct  me  thither,  I  say,  and  set 
her  free!  4112 


MEPHISTOPHELES. 

I  will  conduct  thee.  And  what  I  can  do, — bear!  Have 
I  all  power  in  heaven  and  upon  ejfrth?  I’ll  cloud  the  senses 
of  the  warder, — do  thou  possess  thyself  of  the  keys  and 
lead  her  forth  with  human  hand!  I  will  keep  watch!  The 
magic  steeds  are  waiting,  I  bear  thee  off.  Thus  much  is

She  dwells  immur’d  within  these  dripping  walls;

Thou  dread’st  to  see  her  face  once  more?  4130

I’m  still  so  young,  so  young — 

And  must  so  early  die! 

Fair  was  I  too,  and  that  was  my  undoing.  4155 

My  love  is  now  afar,  he  then  was  nigh; 

Torn  lies  the  garland,  the  fair  blossoms  strew’d. 

Nay,  seize  me  not  with  hand  so  rude! 

Spare  me!  What  harm  have  1  e’er  done  to  thee?

Gladness  I  ne’er  again  shall  know. 

Then  they  sing  songs  about  me — ’tis  wicked  of  the  throng —

Where  is  he?  I  heard  him  calling  me. 

Free  am  I!  There's  none  shall  hinder  me. 

To  his  neck  will  1  fly,  4185 

On  his  bosom  will  lie! 

Gretchen,  he  called!  On  yon  threshold  he  stood; 

Amid  all  the  howling  of  hell’s  fiery  flood, 

The  scoff  and  the  scorn  of  its  devilish  crew, 

The  tones  of  his  voice,  sweet  and  loving,  I  knew.  4190

Ah  haste!  For  if  thou  still  delayest.

How.  dearest?  canst  thou  kiss  no  more! 

So  short  a  time  away  from  me,  and  yet,  4205 

To  kiss  thou  couldst  so  soon  forget! 

Why  on  thy  neck  so  anxious  do  I  feel — 

When  formerly  a  perfect  heaven  of  bliss 

From  thy  dear  looks  and  words  would  o’er  me  steal? 

As  thou  wouldst  stifle  me  thou  then  didst  kiss!  4210 

Kiss  me! 

Or  I’ll  kiss  thee!  (She  embraces  him.) 

Woe!  woe!  Thy  lips  are  cold.

Come!  Follow  me,  my  dearest  love,  be  bold! 

I'll  cherish  thee  with  ardor  thousandfold;

Thou  wilt  strike  off  my  chain. 

And  thou  wilt  take  me  to  thine  arms  again. 

IIow  comes  it  that  thou  dost  not  shrink  from  me? — 

And  dost  thou  know,  love,  whom  thou  wouldst  set  free?

Come!  come!  already  night  begins  to  wane.  4225

There’s  blood  thereon.

Oh,  dearest,  let  the  past  forgotten  be!

No,  thou  must  linger  here  in  sorrow! 

The  graves  I  will  describe  to  thee,  4240 

And  thou  to  them  must  see 

To-morrow: 

The  best  place  give  to  my  mother. 

Close  at  her  side  my  brother, 

Me  at  some  distance  lay —  4245 

But  not  too  far  away! 

And  the  little  one  place  on  my  right  breast. 

Nobody  else  will  near  me  lie! 

To  nestle  beside  thee  so  lovingly. 

That  was  a  rapture,  gracious  and  sweet!  4250 

A  rapture  I  never  again  shall  prove; 

Methinks  I  would  force  myself  on  thee,  love. 

And  thou  dost  spurn  me,  and  back  retreat — 

Yet  ’tis  thyself,  thy  fond  kind  looks  I  see.

If  thou  dost  feel  ’tis  I,  then  come  with  me!  4255

’Tis  wretched  to  beg,  as  I  must  do, 

And  with  an  evil  conscience  thereto!  4265 

’Tis  wretched,  in  foreign  lands  to  stray; 

And  me  they  will  catch,  do  what  I  may!

Quick!  Quick!

Keep  to  the  path 
The  brook  along, 

Over  the  bridge 
To  the  wood  beyond, 

To  the  left,  where  the  plank  is.

There  sits  my  mother  upon  a  stone, 

And  to  and  fro  she  shakes  her  head; 

She  winks  not,  she  nods  not,  her  head  it  droops  sore;
